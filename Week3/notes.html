    <h1>Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapter 5</h1>
    <p>
        Six primitive data types:
        strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null
    </p>
    <p>
        CREATING OBJECTS
        An object in Javascript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.
        If a property's value is a function, it is known as a method.
        An object literal is created directly in the language by wrapping all the properties and methods in curly braces {}
        An example of an object literal:
        const superman = {
            name: 'Superman',
            'real name': 'Clark Kent',
            height: 75,
            weight: 235,
            hero: true,
            villain: false,
            allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],
            fly() {
                return 'Up, up and away!';
            }
        };
        All objects are mutable when the program is running. it's properties and methods can be changed
        and new methods or properties can be added to the object, even if it was created as a "const"

        ACCESSING PROPERTIES
        You can access the properties of an object by using the dot notation: superman.name
        You can also access the object's properties by using bracket notation: superman['name']
        This is the only way to access non standard property and method names that don't follow the variable naming method.

        COMPUTED PROPERTIES
        Starting in ES6 JavaScript code can be placed inside square brackets and the property key will be the return value of that code.
        
        CALLING methods
        can use dot or bracket notation
        superman.fly()
    <<  'Up, up and away!'
        superman['fly']()
    << 'Up, up and away!'
    </p>
    <p>
        CHECKING IF PROPERTIES OR METHODS EXIST
        The in operator can be used to check whether an object has a particular property.
        Another way is to use the hasOwnProperty() method. 

        FINDING ALL THE PROERTIES OF AN OBJECT
        We can loop through all of an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop.

        ADDING PROPERTIES
        We can add properties to an object at any time in a program.

        CHANGING PROPERTIES
        You can change the properties of an object at any time using an assignment.

        REMOVING PROPERTIES
        Properties can be removed from an object using the delete operator.

        NESTED OBJECTS
        It is possible to have objects within other objects. These are called Nested Objects

        OBJECTS ARE COPIED BY REFERENCE
        An important concept to get your head around is that objects are assigned byreference. 
        This means that if a variable is assigned to an object that already exists, it will 
        simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any changes made usingeitherreference 
        will affect the same object.

        OBJECTS AS PARAMETERS TO functions
        An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function.

        This
        The keyword this refers to the object that it is within. 
        It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties.

        NAMESPACING
        A solution to this problem is to use theobject literal patternto create a namespace 
        for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an object literal that 
        serves as the namespace, then adding any values as properties of that object, and any 
        functions as methods.

        MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS
        The Math object has eight properties that represent a mix of commonly used math constants. Note that they are all named in capital letters, as is the convention for constant values:

Math.PI // The ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle
<< 3.141592653589793
Math.SQRT2 // The square root of 2
<< 1.4142135623730951
Math.SQRT1_2 // The reciprocal of the square root of 2
<< 0.7071067811865476
Math.E // Euler's constant
<< 2.718281828459045
Math.LN2 // The natural logarithm of 2
<< 0.6931471805599453
Math.LN10 // The natural logarithm of 10
<< 2.302585092994046
Math.LOG2E // Log base 2 of Euler's constant
<< 1.4426950408889634
Math.LOG10E // Log base 10 of Euler's constant
<< 0.4342944819032518

MATH methods
Absolute math.abs 
Rounding 
    math.ceil will round up to the next integer
    math.floor will round down to the next integer, or leave it along if it is already an integer
    math.round will round the number to the nearest integer
    math.trunc will truncate a number to its integer
    math.exp() will raise a number to the power of Euler's constant (2.1??)
    math.pow() will raise any number (1st argument) to the power of the second number (second argument)
    math.sqrt() returns the positive square root of a number
    math.cbrt() returns the cube root of numbers (ES6)
    math.hypot() ES6, used for hypotenuse triangles
    math.log() returns the natural logarithm of a number
    math.max() returns max of all arguments
    math.min() returns minimum of all arguments
    math.random() creates a number between 0 and 1

        RegExp
        A regular expression is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the pattern
